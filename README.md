PIC programmer for G850VS

These are the files for a PIC programmer for a Sharp PC-G850V or PC-G850VS pocket computer.
The PIC programmer is from a ciruit i found on the internet. I have had permission to use the circuit
so that people can use it to program PICs. 

The PIC prototype PCB is based on the test circuit in the PC-G850 manual, except that, for some reaosn,
I changed the GPIO line that the LED is driven from. The example program given in the manual will have to 
be adjusted appropriately.
